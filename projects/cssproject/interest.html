        <p>A British three-man rock band formed in 1994. The early genre was centered on alternatives similar to
            Radiohead's early albums. Currently, the band's own hard rock sensibilities are applied to Britpop. By 2016,
            it had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.</p>

        <p>Popular songs include Time Is Running Out, Plug In Baby, Supermassive Black Hole, Hysteria, Starlight,
            Uprise, Resistance, and Madness.</p>

        <p>Their live performances are also spectacular, with elaborate stage designs and impressive light shows. Muse's
            music often explores themes of science fiction, politics, and personal struggles, which I find very
            engaging.</p>

        <h2>Color Choices and Styling</h2>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Emphasized text: #2c3e50</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="de-emphasis">Deemphasized text: #91a6a8 </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                Using hex color code, I chose colors with good contrast still maintaining good readability so that
                readers can see important parts easily.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Link Examples</h3>
        <p>
            Within the same website, a relative link points to a file or resource based on the current site.<br>
            <span class="de-emphasis"> Example of a relative link:</span> <a href="../profile.html">Profile
                Page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            An absolute link, on the other hand, points to a file or resource on a different website.<br>
            <span class="de-emphasis">Example of an absolute link:</span> <a href="https://www.muse.mu">Muse Official
                Website</a>.
