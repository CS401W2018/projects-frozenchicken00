            A British three - man rock band formed in 1994. <br>
            The early genre was centered on alternatives similar to radiohead's early albums. <br>
            Currently, the band's own hard rock sensibilities are applied to Britpop.
            By 2016, it had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. <br>
            Popular songs include Time Is Running Out, Plug In Baby, Supermassive Black Hole, Hysteria, Starlight,
            Uprise, Resistance, and Madness
        </p>
        <p>
            Their live performances are also spectacular, with elaborate stage designs and impressive light shows.
            Muse's music often explores themes of science fiction, politics, and personal struggles, which I find very
            engaging.
