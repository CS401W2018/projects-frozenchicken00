        <p>JPEG is best for photographs and complex images with many colors and gradients. It's ideal for realistic
            scenes, portraits, and landscapes where some loss of quality is acceptable for smaller file sizes.</p>

        <p>GIF is best for images with few colors, sharp edges, and no gradients. It's ideal for simple graphics, logos,
            icons, and animations. GIF supports transparency and can create small, animated images.</p>

        <p>PNG supports lossless compression and full alpha channel transparency.</p>

        <p>To resize a photo enter the desired dimensions using software or modify width and height part in css</p>

        <p>Resizing photos with editing software before uploading is better because:
        <ul>
            <li>It reduces file size, improving page load times</li>
            <li>It ensures better image quality control</li>
            <li>It reduces server storage and bandwidth usage</li>
            <li>It prevents sending unnecessarily large files to mobile devices</li>
            <li>It provides consistent rendering across different devices and browsers</li>
        </ul>
